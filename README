chttp

chttp is a simple HTTP server library developed in C.
It allows for simple request routing.


To-do list:

 - Convert into library structure using CMake.
 - Change error handling so that errors are sent through returning.
 - Make function names and arguments more consistent (pointer vs not pointer on free, make_ vs _new, etc.)
 - Add support for other request types, e.g. POST.
